    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>Pasta fagiolo, hereafter referred to as the classic "Pasta Fazool" is a super easy, inexpensive, and delicious meal that will hold you over for hours. 
    It also has the benefit of having a fair amount of protein to help you build powerful, rounded glutes that may quiver with excitement at the thought of this delicious dish. It's a glorious mixture of pasta and beans, as the name suggests. All mixed together in a light tomatoey sauce.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients You'll Need</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 can of white beans (Cannelloni beans are the best option, honestly)</li>
            <li>1 can of kidney beans</li>
            <li>2-3 carrots</li>
            <li>2-3 celery stalks</li>
            <li>1 large white onion</li>
            <li>1 box of chicken stock</li>
            <li>1/2 tube of tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 can of tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 box of Ditalini pasta</li>
            <li>Olive oil, salt, pepper, dried italian seasoning</li>
            <li>White wine</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>HEAVILY salt your pasta water - I'd go with 7-8tbsp - or more, if you prefer. Don't worry, we're not going to add much, if any, to the finished product. Read box for instructions for an exact amount of water, but it doesn't really matter so long as the pasta actually gets cooked. Set the water to a boil.</li>
                <li>Mirepoix your carrots, onion, and celery. You can go for either larger peices or smaller ones. I prefer smaller so that the vegetable size matches the pasta size, roughly. You can do the same, but remember that the Ditalini will more than double in size when cooked!</li>
                <li>Add olive oil (enough to coat the entire bottom of it in a thin layer) to a hot pan</li>
                <li>Add your mirepoix mixture to the pan. Add salt, pepper, and italian seasoning to taste. Let the vegetables cook down a bit until they're soft. Med-low heat should do for this.</li>
                <li>Once the vegetables have cooked down, add about half of a tube of tomato paste to the mix. Mix it around so that everything is covered. Let the vegetables cook down and allow the entire mixture to become a deep red/brownish color, but don't let it burn! Add more oil if necessary.</li>
                <li>When the mixture has cooked down even further and has a very dark reddish appearance, turn the heat up to medium/medium-high. Add about a 1/2 cup of white wine. This allows the alcohol to de-glaze all of the dark goodness from the bottom, of the pan and adds a tremendous amount of flavor. Allow all of the alcohol to boil off.</li>
                <li>Once the mixture has boiled off all of the alcohol (you'll know because the boozy wine smell has turned into something fragrant and pleasant), add your can of tomatoes. Try to add mostly just the tomatoes, keep a small amount of sauce in the can, you don't want to add the entirity of it.</li>
                <li>Move the contents of the pan into a larger pot of necessary. The pot will hold the entire dish, so be sure it's large enough. A dutch oven is perfect for this. Add a box of chicken stock to the mixture. Turn heat down to low/medium low.</li>
                <li>Open your canned beans. Rinse them off thoroughly. Add the beans to the pot. Allow them to cook further so that they're even softer, and add their flavor to the broth.</li>
                <li>Allow the broth/soup to cook down and come together a bit. Now's a good time to drop your pasta. I also suggest using a spoon to skim off some of the dark red oil that will be floating on the top of the soup. Let the pasta be a little more al dente than you'd normally prefer it, as it will soften up further in the soup.</li>
                <li>Add your pasta to the pot. Mix everything thoroughly. Remove from heat and serve in a bowl. Serve with parmesan cheese.
            </ol>
    Congratulations! You've made pasta fazool!
